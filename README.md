This project is using the Game Theory's Minimax Algorithm to build a smart Tic-Tac-Toe board. The board is created using a package called graphics and users are able to click the board to make their movements. In addition, with the usage of a Minimax Algorithm, the computer will never lose the game. At the end of the game, the board will also display the player score and the AI score.
